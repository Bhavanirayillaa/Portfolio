        <p>Responsive Website Development: I offer professional frontend development services,
             creating websites that adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. 
             By employing responsive design techniques,I also emphasize the importance of responsive design, explaining that it ensures the website will be accessible and user-friendly on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>

          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>Front-end developers often work closely with designers to turn design mockups into functional web interfaces. They are responsible for translating the visual design into HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript</p>

            <h2><strong>STOCK MARKET PREDICTION USING AI</strong></h2>
            <p>The main aim of utilizing AI for stock market prediction is to develop accurate 
              and reliable models that can forecast future stock prices,trends, and market movements.
              The application of artificial intelligence in stock marke analysis seeks to enhance 
              decision-making processes for investors, traders, and financial institutions by leveraging
              advanced algorithms and data-driven insights. The primary goal is to harness the power of AI 
              to provide valuable information that aids in optimizing investment strategies, minimizing risks, 
              and maximizing returns in the dynamic and often unpredictable world of financial markets.</p>

            <h2>EARLY DETECTION OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE USING 
              MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
            <p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disease where the symptoms gradually develop start with a slight tremor in one hand and a feeling of stiffness in the body and it became worse over time. It affects over 6 million people worldwide. At present there is no conclusive result for this disease by non-specialist clinicians, particularly in the early stage of the disease where identification of the symptoms are very difficult in its earlier stages. By using machine learning techniques, the problem can be solved with minimal error rate.Results are produced with maximum accuracy.</p>

            <h2>DEEP LEARNING BASED BRAIN STROKE PREDICTION</h2>
            <p>This approach of predicting analytical procedures for stroke was conducted out using a deep learning network on a brain illness dataset. The objective of this model is to build a deep learning application that uses a convolution neural network to recognize brain strokes.The proposed study predicts and categories strokes using a dataset of CT scan (computed tomography) images.
              The experimental result shows that the proposed model is more effective than some other existing models with a promising 95.5 percent accuracy. We can use this model to diagnose a patient to determine the possibility of getting a stroke at an early stage. Finally, the analysis of stroke concerning different attributes discovered a general pattern among the attributes which have a greater risk of developing stroke disease.</p>
